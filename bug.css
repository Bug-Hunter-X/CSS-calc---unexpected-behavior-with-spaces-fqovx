The CSS property `calc()` is used to perform calculations within CSS. However, there is an uncommon error where the calculation may not work as expected if there are spaces around the operators. For example, the following will not work:

```css
width: calc( 100px + 50px );
```

The correct way to write this is:

```css
width: calc(100px + 50px);
```
